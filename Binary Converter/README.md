# Binary Converter
Takes a number in base 10 and converts it to base 2.

`function [base 2] = binaryConverter(base10)`

Inputs:
- base 10: number in base 10

Outputs:
- base 2: array output of base 10 number converted to base 2

Limitations:

Currently, this algorithm only works for positive integers within the range of MATLAB memory and 0.
